spm_vol_ecat7.m 2.7 00/01/26
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calibration factor from main hdr is now included in the scalefactor
field of the volume handles. This problem was reported by Steven Grant
<sgrant@nida.nih.gov>.

spm_vol_ecat7.m only used a single scale factor (SCALE_FACTOR) from
the ECAT subheader.  This works fine if and only if the images are
uncalibrated (which they are at the FIL).  If the images are expressed
in specific calibration units (e.g. Bq/cc), then one needs to
incorporate a second factor found in the main header
(mh.ECAT_CALIBRATION_FACTOR).  The product of Scale_Factor and
ECAT_CALIBRATION_FACTOR then gives the proper units.

spm_orthviews.m 2.18 00/02/04
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small bug in display of images.  The first row/column was not being
displayed, although the crosshairs were in the correct positions.
This was noticed by JBP just before the SPM99 release, but there was
no chance to fix it.

spm_sn3d.m 2.27 00/02/07
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a tiny little bug in batching in spm_sn3d.m that was found by
Matthew Brett.  Line 444... should read:

iterations = spm_input('# Nonlinear Iterations?','+1','m',...
	['1  nonlinear iteration |3  nonlinear iterations|' ...
	 '5  nonlinear iterations|8  nonlinear iterations|' ...
	 '12 nonlinear iterations|16 nonlinear iterations'],...
	 tmp2, tmp,'batch',{},'nonlin_ite_nb');

spm_segment.m    2.12 00/02/10
spm_coregister.m 2.10 00/02/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Routines modified so that they don't need Graphical displays. This
should allow them to run in batch mode.

spm_platform.m  2.8 00/02/22
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Brett's suggestion from 22/02/00:
Alternatively, perhaps it would be better to replace lines 111-126 with:
	twd = tempdir;
-JA

________________________________________________________________________
spm_hwrite.m   2.3 00/02/22
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"spm_hwrite.m" did not like filenames containing spaces, which should
be perfectly commonplace on PCs.  Joseph Dien found this one.
-JA

________________________________________________________________________
spm_coregister.m 2.11 00/02/23
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numerical instability and underflow problems (which were not causing
warning messages or errors as a matrix pseudo-inverse is used rather
than a proper inverse at line 362 of spm_affsub3.m) solved by modifying
spm_coregister.m at around line 209 so that all the images are scaled
to have roughly the same global intensity.
-JA
________________________________________________________________________
spm_P.m 2.5 00/03/06
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Nichols found an incredibly tiny bug/typo in spm_P.m on line 151:
	c       = (1+t^2/v)^((1-v)/2);
if t is a vector (you pass a vector of statistics to get p-values)
the "t^2" dies with "Matrix must be square".
-JA
________________________________________________________________________
spm_slice_timing.m 2.7 00/03/16
------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to Matthew Brett:
	assuming there is no gap between the end of the
	collection of the last slice, and the beginning
	of the collection of the first slice of the next
	volume, the TA should be specified as
		TA = TR - TR/n

Code modified by Michael Erb:
 line 155: new default value for TA
   old   TA = spm_input('Acquisition Time (TA) {secs}','!+1','e',TR);
   new   TA = spm_input('Acquisition Time (TA) {secs}','!+1','e',TR-TR/nslices);
 line 178: Problem with batch (nargin >= 1)
   old         eval(['P    =    P' num2str(subj) ';']);
   new         if nsubjects > 1, eval(['P    =    P' num2str(subj) ';']); end;

rend.ZIP
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sargo Aalto found that the problem often encountered under NT when
loading the render_*.mat files during the Render Display, may have been
due to a problem with Winzip. Matthew Brett suggested that a .zip file
may be useful.  Alternatively, people could dearchive using EasyZip,
which is free from http://www.bamsystems.com/easyzip/ , or pkzip which
is shareware from http://www.pkware.com, or use the GNU tar utility that
is part of the Cygwin project (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin).
The binary and necessary DLL files are available from Matthew's webspace:
	http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~matthew.brett/ftp/Win_spm99
Download tar.exe and cygwin1.dll into your path, and, from the Windows DOS
prompt, extract the spm99.tgz file with:
	tar -zxf spm99.tgz

spm_sn3d.m 2.28
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed problem reported by Darren Gitelman, in addition to same problem
with bounding box:
| A problem arises in spm_sn3d if one sets the spm global sptl_Vx to 
| empty or 0 OR if one goes into spm_defaults and defines the output 
| voxel sizes to be a runtime option which also sets sptl_Vx to be 0.
| 
| If one then performs a normalization and "Determines Parameters 
| Only," spm_sn3d fails at line 830
| 
| spm_write_sn(P(:,1),matname,bb,Vox,1);
| 
| because Vox is defined to be 0.
| 
| spm_sn3d only asks the user to define the voxel size (as a runtime 
| option) if  either the option write normalized or determine 
| parameters and write normalized were selected. This is because 
| writing out a quick t1 (or object brain) normalization is now a 
| default.

spm_read_vols.m 2.5 00/03/21
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a couple of bugs that Matthew Brett found:
Lines 42, 43 were:
	im = logical(zeros(ni,1));
	for i=1:n, im(i)=~spm_type(Vi(i).dim(4),'NaNrep'); end
but are now:
	im = logical(zeros(n,1));
	for i=1:n, im(i)=~spm_type(V(i).dim(4),'NaNrep'); end
-JA

spm_help.m 2.43 00/03/23
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed problem pointed out by Jan Kremlacek:
Printing the help to PS, was printed in the BBox bigger than A4 format
even when there is no problem with printing of any results.
-JA

spm_coreg_ui.m  2.2 00/03/24
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Stumpf noticed a problem with the batch mode version, in that
line 166 has "PFF" for its lvalue rather than "others".
It has now been fixed.

spm_get_space.m    2.5  00/03/30
spm_sn3d.m         2.29 00/03/30
spm_bch_bchmat.m   2.7  00/03/30
spm_bch_headers.m  2.6  00/03/30
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A recommendation by Matthew Brett (that he just beat me in finding):

Files modified to save as:
	save('x','y','z');
rather than:
	save x y z
This is because of problems (particularly under Windows) with filenames
and directory paths containing spaces.
-JA
________________________________________________________________________
spm_bch_bchmat.m 2.8 00/05/17
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug in version 2.7 found by Petr Janata. The line saying:
	save(spm_str_manip(bch_mfile,'rp'), str)           
was not working since "str" was a string of variable names with
spaces between.

Problems with negative t values (from conjunction analyses). These were
reported and largely fixed by Darren Gitelman.
-JA
________________________________________________________________________
spm_list_files.c 2.8 00/07/06
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fix by Volkmar Glauche that resolves the problem with file
permissions under Linux (files get only displayed in spm_get when they
are world-readable). The reason is at line 28 of the original code
(spm_list_files.c)

 	if (uid == -1)

This returns 0 at all times, since under Linux uid is of type unsigned int
and cannot be negative. Replacing this line with the code

 	if (uid == (uid_t)-1)

works with Linux and should not change behaviour on other systems.

spm_orthviews.m 2.22 00/07/21
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included some modifications by Matthew Brett that are to do with
displaying coloured images.  The main reason for inclusion here is
because of the fix for the problem reported by Steve Fromm:

| I don't understand the following behavior:
| 1.  Display the epi.img template, using World Space.  [Say that image
| displayed in Position A]
| 2.  Set yaw = pi/6; image rotates [Position B]
| 3.  Switch to voxel space (leaving yaw set at pi/6); image rotates back to
| the initial position [Position A]
| 4.  Set yaw = 0; image rotates. [Position C; opposite direction, in the
| axial plane]
| 5.  Return to World Space; image rotates back to Position A.
| 6.  Back to Voxel Space; image still in Position A.

What was happening was that any reorienting is undone in the display
when you switch from World->Voxel spaces.

spm_sn3d.m 2.30 00/08/07
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Brett found a truly miniscule bug in spm_sn3d.m.
Line 352 of spm_sn3d.m is missing a quote:
subj(i).objmask = spm_input('batch', {},objmask',i);
should be:
subj(i).objmask = spm_input('batch', {},'objmask',i);

________________________________________________________________________
spm_graph.m 2.29 00/09/14
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor bug in spm_graph.m, affecting plots of event-related fitted
response with PSTH (with no session average). It was found and fixed
by Jorge Armony (ucjtnga@ucl.ac.uk) who replaced line 418
	Y     = Y*ones(length(ss))/length(ss);
with
	Y     = sum(Y,2)/length(ss);
________________________________________________________________________
spm_transverse.m 2.18 00/10/13
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor bug in displaying the titles - discovered by Michele Piana.
The z=?? part for the planes above and below were determined based on
the assumption that the images had been spatially normalised.
________________________________________________________________________
spm_platform.m  2.10 00/11/08
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified (by Volkmar Glauche) to include "GLNX86", which is what Matlab6
reports as the computer platform on Linux boxes
(see spm99_mexglx.tar.gz).
________________________________________________________________________
spm99_mexglx.tar.gz 00/11/09
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation of mex files for Linux machines for running under Matlab 6.
