% /TEMPLATES/ DIRECTORY
% This directory contains images for use as templates for spatially
% normalizing  images to the same stereotactic space.  The space is
% based upon the Talairach system, but does  not  make  assumptions
% about  brain  symmetry,  and  also  includes the cerebellum.  The
% stereotactic  space   is  based  on  152   brains  from  Montréal
% Neurological  Institute,  and  will eventually be replaced in due
% course by a 450-brain version for the entire ICBM consortium.
% 
% In SPM96, we released  a  single  subject  brain  for  use  as  a
% template.   Although  the  MNI  gave  us  this  data,  they never
% recommended that this brain  should  be  used  as  a  stereotaxic
% standard.   This   is  something  that we at the FIL chose to do.
% The official standard  for  the   ICBM   stereotactic  space   is
% the   MNI305  brain  -  which  this was not.  This brain has many
% merits for simulation but it  suffers   from   all   the   single
% brain  criticisms  that apply to Talairach.  In this release, the
% single subject T1 has been replaced by a 152 subject average.  We
% (in  the  SPM  group)  chose  to  use the 152 subject T1-weighted
% average rather than the 305 brain average because there are  also
% T2-,  and  PD-weighted  images of the same subjects.  This should
% allow  much  more  flexibility  in  the  range  of  different  MR
% contrasts   that   can   be  spatially  normalized  to  the  same
% stereotaxic space (by registering  to  a  linear  combination  of
% template images).

% templates/T1.img
% ----------------
% Image  derived  from   icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc,   which   was
% originally  supplied  by  Alan Evans, MNI, Canada (ICBM, NIH P-20
% project, Principal Investigator John Mazziotta).  The  image  was
% reduced to 2mm isotropic resolution and smoothed with an 8mm FWHM
% Gaussian filter.
% 
% templates/T2.img
% ----------------
% Image  derived  from   icbm_avg_152_t2_tal_lin.mnc,   which   was
% originally  supplied  by  Alan Evans, MNI, Canada (ICBM, NIH P-20
% project, Principal Investigator John Mazziotta).  The  image  was
% reduced to 2mm isotropic resolution and smoothed with an 8mm FWHM
% Gaussian filter.
% 
% templates/PD.img
% ----------------
% Image  derived  from   icbm_avg_152_pd_tal_lin.mnc,   which   was
% originally  supplied  by  Alan Evans, MNI, Canada (ICBM, NIH P-20
% project, Principal Investigator John Mazziotta).  The  image  was
% reduced to 2mm isotropic resolution and smoothed with an 8mm FWHM
% Gaussian filter.
% 
% templates/EPI.img
% -------------
% The image was created from the average of 13 subjects  mean  fMRI
% images.   The  grey matter was segmented from the original images
% using the segmentation in SPM.  This was spatially normalized  by
% matching  to  the  apriori/gray.img  file  using  a  12-parameter
% affine  registration,  followed   by   a nonlinear   registration
% (using   the   7x8x7   lowest  frequency  DCT  coefficients,  and
% heavy   regularization).     These    estimated  parameters  were
% then  applied  to the functional images, which were then averaged
% and smoothed with an 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.  The  EPI   images
% were  acquired  on  a  Siemens Vision scanner working at 2T.  The
% original resolution of the images was an  isotropic   3mm  (1.8mm
% slice   thickness   +  1.2mm  gap).  A gradient echo sequence was
% used with TE@ms and a TR of about 3s.  Inter echo spacing  is 800
% micro   seconds   with   a   sinusoidal   gradient  waveform  and
% nonlinear ADC sampling.  Nyquist ghost  suppression  is  achieved
% using  a  2  echo  reference  scan  (only 0th and 1st order phase
% correction implemented). Maximum  gradient  strength  is  approx.
% 20mT/m.

% 
% templates/filT1.img
% -------------------
% Average of images from 12  subjects  spatially  normalized  to  a
% linear  combination  of  T1.img,  T2.img  and  PD.img using a 12-
% parameter  affine  transformation,   followed  by   a   nonlinear
% registration  (using the 7x8x7 lowest frequency DCT coefficients,
% and medium regularization).  Images acquired on a 2 Tesla Siemens
% Magnetom  Vision scanner at the FIL,  using a T1 weighted  MPRAGE
% sequence  (TRel=9.7, TEch=4, TInv=600, Fang=12, SThi=1.5).   Same
% subjects    were   also    used    for    templates/PET.img   and
% templates/Transm.img.   This image is included  as   it  has  the
% same  contrast as the T1 weighted images from the FIL  (so we can
% use it for spatial normalization).
% Subject numbers: 617 622 627 630 639 662 817 824 825 826 827 828.
% 
% templates/PET.img
% -----------------
% Average of images from 12 subjects spatially normalized to  ICBM.
% Images  were  first  registered to the T1-weighted MR images, and
% spatially transformed using the same transformation.  Images were
% acquired  on  a  Siemens  ECAT  HR+  at  the FIL, using Oxygen-15
% labeled water. Averaged images smoothed using 8mm FWHM  Gaussian.
% Subject numbers: 617 622 627 630 639 662 817 824 825 826 827 828.
% 
% templates/Transm.img
% --------------------
% Average transmission image of 11 subjects.  Template generated in
% similar way to PET.img.
% Subject numbers: 617 622 627 630 639 662 817 824 825 827 828.
%
% templates/SPECT.img
% -------------------
% The SPECT template was created by Leighton Barnden et al from the
% Department of Nuclear Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
% Adelaide and  was  used  in  their  SPECT  to  MR  coregistration
% validation. It is the mean of 22 normal female subjects. Each was
% scanned after injection of Tc-99m HMPAO on a triple  head  camera
% with ultra-high resolution fanbeam collimators using a 126-154keV
% (20%) photopeak and a 111-125 keV  scatter  window.  After  lower
% window   scatter   subtraction   (1.5xscatter   images  after  2D
% Butterworth smooth with cutoff 0.25  cycles/cm,  order  3.0)  the
% photopeak projections were rebinned, pre-filtered (2D Butterworth
% smooth with cutoff 0.7  cycles/cm,order  6.0)  and  reconstructed
% using  Filtered  BackProjection.   The  SPECT tomograms were then
% coregistered to the subject's 3D T1  MR  using  AMIR.  Parameters
% from  SPM99b MR to MR Spatial Normalisation (affine + non-linear)
% were used  to  transform  the  SPECT  images  to  SPM's  standard
% anatomical space. The mean yielded the SPECT template.

% apriori/gray.img, apriori/white.img & apriori/csf.img
% ----------------  -----------------   ---------------
% Images supplied by  Alan  Evans,  MNI,  Canada  (ICBM,  NIH  P-20
% project,  Principal  Investigator  John Mazziotta).  Original 1mm
% resolution images were  icbm_avg_151_gm.mnc,  icbm_avg_151_wm.mnc
% and    icbm_avg_151_csf.mnc.     Images    were    masked   using
% average_305_mask_1mm.mnc, reduced to 2mm resolution and  smoothed
% using   an   8mm  FWHM  Gaussian.   These  images  represent  the
% probabilities of finding gray matter, white  matter  or  cerebro-
% spinal  fluid  at  any  point. These volumes are used largely for
% image segmentation, although they can be used  as  templates  for
% spatial  normalization.  151  subjects  were  used to create each
% volume.
% 
% apriori/brainmask
% -----------------
% Image derived from average_305_mask_1mm.mnc, which was originally
% supplied  by  Alan  Evans,  MNI,  Canada (ICBM, NIH P-20 project,
% Principal  Investigator  John  Mazziotta).   The  original  image
% contained ones and zeros, where ones represented voxels that were
% part of the brain.  It was subsequently  smoothed  using  an  8mm
% FWHM  Gaussian.   This  volume  can be used to weight the spatial
% normalization so that the final solution  is  not  influenced  by
% voxels outside the brain.

% canonical/single_subj_T1.img
% ----------------------------
% A T1 weighted MRI of  a  representative  male  individual.   This
% image  was  used  for  the  T1  template supplied with SPM96.  It
% should be noted that the MNI never recommended this  brain  as  a
% stereotactic  standard.   This  is  something  that we at the FIL
% chose to do.  The official standard  for  the  ICBM  stereotactic
% space  is  the  MNI305 brain - which this is not.  This brain has
% many merits for simulation but it suffers  from  all  the  single
% brain criticisms that apply to Talairach.

% This is contrary to the orientation that Analyze  expects  images
