%
% NMH_ACQCORRECT  Correct differences in image acquisition time between slices
%   This routine is intended to correct for the staggered order of
%   slice acquisition that is used during echoplanar scanning. The
%   correction is necessary to make the data on each slice correspond
%   to the same point in time. Without correction, the data on one
%   slice will represent a point in time as far removed as 1/2 the TR
%   from an adjacent slice (in the case of an interleaved sequence).
%
%   This routine "shifts" a signal in time to provide an output
%   vector that represents the same (continuous) signal sampled
%   starting either later or earlier. This is accomplished by a simple
%   shift of the phase of the sines that make up the signal.
%
%   Recall that a Fourier transform allows for a representation of any
%   signal as the linear combination of sinusoids of different
%   frequencies and phases. Effectively, we will add a constant
%   to the phase of every frequency, shifting the data in time.
%
%    Shifter - This is the filter by which the signal will be convolved
%    to introduce the phase shift. It is constructed explicitly in
%    the Fourier domain. In the time domain, it may be described as
%    an impulse (delta function) that has been shifted in time the
%    amount described by TimeShift.
%
%   The correction works by lagging (shifting forward) the time-series
%     data on each slice using sinc-interpolation. This results in each
%     time series having the values that would have been obtained had
%     the slice been acquired at the beginning of each TR.
%
%   To make this clear, consider a neural event (and ensuing hemodynamic
%     response) that occurs simultaneously on two adjacent slices. Values
%     from slice "A" are acquired starting at time zero, simultaneous to
%     the neural event, while values from slice "B" are acquired one
%     second later. Without corection, the "B" values will describe a
%     hemodynamic response that will appear to have began one second
%     EARLIER on the "B" slice than on slice "A". To correct for this,
%     the "B" values need to be shifted towards the Right, i.e., towards
%     the last value.
%
%   This correction assumes that the data are band-limited (i.e. there
%     is no meaningful information present in the data at a frequency
%     higher than that of the Nyquist). This assumption is support by
%     the study of Josephs et al (1997, NeuroImage) that obtained
%     event-related data at an effective TR of 166 msecs. No physio-
%     logical signal change was present at frequencies higher than our
%     typical Nyquist (0.25 HZ).
%
%   NOTE WELL:  This correction should be the first performed (i.e.,
%     before orienting, motion correction, padding, smoothing, etc.).
%     Additionally, it should only be performed once!
