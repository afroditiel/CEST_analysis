function spm_realign_ui(arg1)
% Within Mode Image Realignment
%___________________________________________________________________________
%
% This routine realigns a time-series of images acquired from the same subject 
% using a least squares approach and a 6 parameter (rigid body) spatial 
% transformation.  The first image in the list specified by the user is used
% as a reference to which all subsequent scans are realigned.  The reference
% scan does not have to the the first chronologically and it may be wise to
% chose a 'representative scan' in this role.
%
% For fMRI data an additional adjustment is made to the data that removes
% a tiny amount of the movement-related confounds of these effects.
% However, it may be preferable to include the functions of the estimated
% movement parameters as confounds in the statistics part.
%
%
% Uses
% Primarily to remove movement artefact in fMRI and PET time-series (or more 
% generally longitudinal studies)
%
%
% Inputs
% A series of *.img conforming to SPM data format (see 'Data Format').  The 
% relative displacement of the images should be small with respect to their 
% resolution.  This is usually easy to ensure for functional images (e.g. 
% fMRI, PET SPECT).
%
%
% Outputs
% The parameter estimation part writes out ".mat" files for each of the
% input images.  The part of the routine that writes the resliced images
% uses information in these ".mat" files and writes the realigned *.img
% files to the same subdirectory prefixed with an 'r' (i.e. r*.img).  The
% details of the transformation are displayed in the results window as
% plots of translation and rotation.
% A set of realignment parameters are saved for each session, named:
% realignment_params_*.txt.

%
% --- The Prompts Explained ---
%
% 'number of subjects'
% Enter the number of subjects you wish to realign.
%
% For fMRI, it will ask you the number of sessions for each subject.
% In the coregistration step, the sessions are first realigned to
% each other, by aligning the first scan from each session to the
% first scan of the first session.  Then the images within each session
% are aligned to the first image of the session.
% The parameter estimation is performed this way because it is assumed
% (rightly or not) that there may be systematic differences
% in the images between sessions.
% The adjustment step (correcting for resampling artifacts) is also
% performed completely independantly between each of the fMRI sessions.
%
% 'select scans for subject ..'
% Select the scans you wish to realign. All operations are relative
% to the first image selected.
%
% ......... Note that not all of the following prompts may be used: .........
%
% 'Which option?'
% 	'Coregister only'
% 	Only determine the parameters required to transform each of the
% 	images 2..n to the same space as image 1.
% 	The determined parameters for image XXXX.img are saved in the
%	file XXXX.mat. This is a Matlab file, containing the matrix 'M'.
% 	The location of an image voxel (in mm) can be determined by
% 	computing M(1:3,:)*[xcoord ycoord zcoord 1].
%	Note that if the coregistration is performed more than once on
%	the unresliced data, the starting estimates are obtained from
% 	parameters stored in the '.mat' files.
%	Note that for PET, the coregistration is a two step process.
%	First of all, the images are all realigned to the first in
%	the series.  A mean of these realigned images is created, and
%	a second pass realignment is performed to realign all the
%	images to the mean. Finally, the parameters are corrected
%	for any differences estimated by registering the first image in
%	the series to the mean image.
%
% 	'Reslice Only'
% 	Reslice the specified images according to the contents of the
% 	previously determined parameters. The images are resliced to be
% 	in the same space as the first one selected.  For fMRI, this is
%	the first image of the first session.
%
% 	'Coregister & Reslice'
% 	Combine the above two steps together.
%
%
% Options for reslicing:
%
% 'Create what?'
% 	'All Images (1..n)'
% 	This reslices all the images - including the first image selected
% 	- which will remain in it's original position.
%
%	'Images 2..n'
% 	Reslices images 2..n only. Useful for if you wish to reslice
% 	(for example) a PET image to fit a structural MRI, without
% 	creating a second identical MRI volume.
%
%	'All Images + Mean Image'
% 	In addition to reslicing the images, it also creates a mean of the
% 	resliced image.
%
%	'Mean Image Only'
% 	Creates the mean image only.
%
% 'Mask the images?'
% To avoid artifactual movement-related variance.
% Because of subject motion, different images are likely to have different
% patterns of zeros from where it was not possible to sample data.
% With masking enabled, the program searches through the whole time series
% looking for voxels which need to be sampled from outside the original
% images. Where this occurs, that voxel is set to zero for the whole set
% of images (unless the image format can represent NaN, in which case
% NaNs are used where possible).
%
% 'Adjust sampling errors?' (fMRI only)
% Adjust the data (fMRI) to remove interpolation errors arising from the
% reslicing of the data.  The adjustment for each fMRI session is performed
% independantly of any other session.  Bayesian statistics are used to
% attempt to regularize the adjustment in order to prevent an excessive
% amount of signal from being removed.  A priori variances for coefficients
% are assumed to be stationary and are estimated by translating the first
% image by a number of different distances using both Fourier and sinc
% interpolation.  This gives a ball park figure on how much error is
% likely to arise because of the approximations in the sinc interpolation.
% The certainty of the solution is obtained from the residuals after
% fitting the optimum linear combination of the basis functions through
% the data.  Estimates of certainty based on the residuals are
% unfortunately just an approximation.   
% We still don't fully understand the nature of the movement artifacts
% that arise using fMRI.  The current model is simply attempting to remove
% interpolation errors.  There are many other sources of error that the
% model does not attempt to remove.
% It is possible that adjusting the data without taking into account
% the design matrix for the statistics may be problematic when there are
% stimulous correlated movements, since adjusting seperately requires the
% assumption that the movements are independant from the paradigm.  It
% MAY BE BE BETTER TO INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED MOTION PARAMETERS AS CONFOUNDS
% WHEN THE STATISTICS ARE RUN.  The motion parameters are saved for each
% session, so this should be easily possible.
%
% 'Reslice Interpolation Method?'
% 	'Trilinear Interpolation'
% 	Use trilinear interpolation (first-order hold) to sample the images
%       during the writing of realigned images.
%
% 	'Sinc Interpolation'
% 	Use a sinc interpolation to sample the images during the writing
%	of realigned images.
% 	This is slower than bilinear interpolation, but produces better
% 	results. It is especially recommended for fMRI time series.
%	An 9x9x9 kernel is used to resample the images. 
%
%	'Fourier space Interpolation' (fMRI only)
%	Rigid body rotations are executed as a series of shears, which
%	are performed in Fourier space (Eddy et. al. 1996).  This routine
%	only supports cubic voxels (since zooms can not be done by
%	convolution in Fourier space).
%	No adjustment is available for this.
%
%__________________________________________________________________________
%
% The `.mat' files.
%
% This simply contains a 4x4 affine transformation matrix in a variable `M'.
% These files are normally generated by the `realignment' and
% `coregistration' modules.  What these matrixes contain is a mapping from
% the voxel coordinates (x0,y0,z0) (where the first voxel is at coordinate
% (1,1,1)), to coordinates in millimeters (x1,y1,z1).  By default, the
% the new coordinate system is derived from the `origin' and `vox' fields
% of the image header.
%  
% x1 = M(1,1)*x0 + M(1,2)*y0 + M(1,3)*z0 + M(1,4)
% y1 = M(2,1)*x0 + M(2,2)*y0 + M(2,3)*z0 + M(2,4)
% z1 = M(3,1)*x0 + M(3,2)*y0 + M(3,3)*z0 + M(3,4)
%
% Assuming that image1 has a transformation matrix M1, and image2 has a
% transformation matrix M2, the mapping from image1 to image2 is: M2\M1
% (ie. from the coordinate system of image1 into millimeters, followed
% by a mapping from millimeters into the space of image2).
%
% These `.mat' files allow several realignment or coregistration steps to be
% combined into a single operation (without the necessity of resampling the
% images several times).  The `.mat' files are also used by the spatial
% normalisation module.
